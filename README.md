# OpenGLIMAC
OpenGL / C++ Project for the second year of IMAC school

# Install & Running

 - Install the program by running the command ./install at the directory root
 - Launch it by running the command ./launch

# For developper

 - Update the build by running ./update
 - Update the make by running ./cmake_update 

# How the system work

 - All the command are in the root, and there is a "files" folder aswell
 - The folder you nver touch is build, it's the one created by the install and that is running by the launch
 - All the cpp and hpp created by us are in the engine folder. If you want to add something, there you go. Whenever you want to include one of the engine files, you just have to include "engine/name_of_your_files.hpp" and the cmake do the rest. 
 - The main.cpp and the shaders are in the folder named "game".
 - All the 3D Models we use are in the assets folder. You could find sound and some kind of stuff there. 
 - Glimac and Third-party are the library we used (Assimp, glm, gtest and Glimac). 


Enjoy ;-)
