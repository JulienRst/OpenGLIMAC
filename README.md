# OpenGLIMAC
OpenGL / C++ Project for the second year of IMAC school

 - To run the project, create a "build" folder
 - cd into this new folder and run cmake ../GLImac-template
 - Now you can make the project simply using "make" cmd. 
 - Everytime you create a file into the GLImac-template you have to re-run the cmake thing
 - Else the make system run as always, everytime you change something into your code, make and ./path_of_file to run it. 
 - When you want to push your work into this repository please make sure you just git add .GLImac-template and not your build folder, we don't want it ;-)


Enjoy ;-)
